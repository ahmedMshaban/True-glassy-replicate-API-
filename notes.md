  - Test the endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
- **PR**: Complete RESTful endpoints.

### Day 6: Unit Testing

- **Task**: Write unit tests for all implemented endpoints.
  - Use Django's testing framework to create test cases for each endpoint.
  - Ensure tests cover various scenarios and edge cases.
